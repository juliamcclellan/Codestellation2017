      <h3>What is our mission?</h3>
      <p>CommuniTree aims to help build community gardens everywhere. We firmly believe that the keeping and maintenance of communal green space truly helps strengthen community bonds, bringing everyone together in collaborative appreciation of nature. </p>
      <p>That said, we know that starting a community garden can be hard. CommuniTree provides a set of resources to help you on your way, like showing you what plants to start with, how to take of them, and more.</p>

      <h3>Why start a community garden?</h3>
      <p>None of us can save the environment or build strong community ties on our own. We need to collaborate and come together in order to create meaningful change. A community garden seems small, but it's the first step--and one that can provide not only a sense of community, but also some delicious fruits and vegetables for everyone.</p>
